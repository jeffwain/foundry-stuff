## Setup

I used this setup with Item Macros before activities were added, but now I need to make an activity for each type of spend you want to allow. The one benefit of this approach is that you can add more detailed descriptions of the inspiration spend (e.g. for something like KibblesTasty's Heroic inspiration <https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Ldu8CT4gMByDrAKvmQ5>).

**Inspiration setup**

- Create an item for each player called "Inspiration" that can track charges, with a maximum value.
- Set up the macro to roll with each item's use (using Item Macros) or add the macro to all players' toolbars (no Item Macros)
