## Setup

I used this setup with Item Macros before activities were added, but now I need to make an activity for each type of spend you want to allow. The one benefit of this approach is that you can add more detailed descriptions of the inspiration spend (e.g. for something like KibblesTasty's Heroic inspiration <https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Ldu8CT4gMByDrAKvmQ5>).

**Inspiration setup**

- Create an item for each player called "Inspiration" that can track charges, with a maximum value.

**Grit use**

- First you'll need a Grit feature to track use of grit, then you have two options for spending it. Either method should consume the Grit uses.
  1. Create activities for each available use of grit beneath the Grit feature
  2. Create separate features for each use of Grit (e.g. Buck Up) that consume the grit feature
