## Setup

I used this setup with Item Macros before activities were added, but now I need to make an activity for each type of spend you want to allow. The one benefit of this approach is that you can add more detailed descriptions of the inspiration spend (e.g. for something like KibblesTasty's Heroic inspiration <https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Ldu8CT4gMByDrAKvmQ5>).

**Inspiration setup**

- Create an item for each player called "Inspiration" that can track charges. Import the data from `item-inspiration.json`.
- Add `macro-give-inspiration` to the GM's toolbar. Run the macro to dole out inspiration.
